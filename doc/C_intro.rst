.. _C_intro:

Introduction
************

This section contains instructions for writing code that calls AOCL-DA using the C APIs and for building
applications that link to the library.
Numerous example programs are also provided in the ``examples`` folder within your
AOCL-DA installation directory.

The C interface has been designed to make it as seamless as
possible to integrate with the library from whichever programming language you are using.
In addition, a header file containing :ref:`C++ overloads<cpp_overloads>` is available for C++ users who wish to abstract away the floating-point data type.

Library Workflow
================

The intended workflow for using the AOCL-DA C APIs is as follows:

1. **Load data from memory.** Data can be obtained from various sources:

  * pass arrays of data directly from another part of your application;
  * read directly from CSV files into floating-point or integer arrays;
  * read mixed data from CSV files into a :cpp:type:`da_datastore`.

2. **Data preprocessing.** Functions are available for:

  * standardizing, scaling and shifting arrays of floating point data;
  * removing missing data from a :cpp:type:`da_datastore`;
  * selecting certain subsets of the data in a :cpp:type:`da_datastore`;
  * extracting contiguous arrays of data from a :cpp:type:`da_datastore`.

3. **Data processing.** This is often split into several function calls:

  * initialize a :cpp:type:`da_handle` struct, which is used internally to store
    algorithmic information;
  * pass arrays of data, or data extracted from a :cpp:type:`da_datastore` to the
    handle (for best possible
    performance, algorithmic functions typically operate on two-dimension arrays
    stored in column major format);
  * computation (e.g. clustering, linear model, principal component analysis);
  * extract results from the :cpp:type:`da_handle`.


Linking your Application to AOCL-DA
===================================

Linking on Linux
------------------
These instructions assume your application is written in C++, but the AOCL-DA C APIs have been
designed to make calling from other languages as straightforward as possible.
In the example compilation commands below, ``INT_LIB`` is either ``LP64`` or
``ILP64`` for 32 and 64 bit integers respectively.

To compile and link to static AOCL libraries using ``g++``:

.. code-block::

    g++ <your_source_code>.cpp -I /<path to aocl-da headers>/include_<INT_LIB>
        /<path to aocl-da>/lib_<INT_LIB>/libaocl-da.a /<path to libflame>/lib_<INT_LIB>/libflame.a
        /<path to blis>/lib_<INT_LIB>/libblis-mt.a -lgfortran -lgomp

To compile and link to static AOCL libraries using ``clang++``:

.. code-block::

    clang++ <your_source_code>.cpp -I /<path to aocl-da headers>/include_<INT_LIB>
            /<path to aocl-da>/lib_<INT_LIB>/libaocl-da.a /<path to libflame>/lib_<INT_LIB>/libflame.a
            /<path to blis>/lib_<INT_LIB>/libblis-mt.a -lflang -lomp

To compile and link to dynamic AOCL libraries using ``g++``:

.. code-block::

    g++ <your_source_code>.cpp -I /<path to aocl-da headers>/include_<INT_LIB>
        -L /<path to aocl-da>/lib_<INT_LIB> -L /<path to libflame>/lib_<INT_LIB>
        -L /<path to blis>/lib_<INT_LIB> -laocl-da -lflame -lblis-mt
        -lgfortran -lgomp

To compile and link to dynamic AOCL libraries using ``clang++``:

.. code-block::

    clang++ <your_source_code>.cpp -I /<path to aocl-da headers>/include_<INT_LIB>
            -L /<path to aocl-da>/lib_<INT_LIB> -L /<path to libflame>/lib_<INT_LIB>
            -L /<path to blis>/lib_<INT_LIB> -laocl-da -lflame -lblis-mt
            -lflang -lomp

Note that for dynamic linking you will need to update your ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment
variable e.g. ``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<AOCL_ROOT>/lib_<INT_LIB>``.

If you wish to call AOCL-DA from a C code, then you should compile using your C compiler
(e.g. ``gcc``), but link separately, using a C++ linker (e.g. ``g++``).

Linking on Windows
------------------

In the example compilation command below, ``INT_LIB`` is either ``LP64`` or ``ILP64``
for 32 and 64 bit integers respectively.

.. code-block::

    cl <example_name>.cpp /I \<path to aocl-da headers>\include\<INT_LIB> /EHsc /MD
       \<path to aocl-da>\lib\<INT_LIB>\aocl-da.lib
       \<path to libflame>\lib\<INT_LIB>\AOCL-LibFlame-Win-MT-dll.lib
       \<path to blis>\lib\<INT_LIB>\AOCL-LibBlis-Win-MT-dll.lib /openmp:llvm

The same command should work with ``cl`` replaced by ``clang-cl`` (in which case, simply use ``/openmp``) and linking statically using ``/MT``.

.. note::
   You should ensure the folders containing the libraries to be linked are on your
   Windows ``PATH`` environment variable e.g. using ``set PATH=%PATH%;C:\<path_to_BLAS_and_LAPACK>``.
   Depending on how your system is set up, and which functions you are using, you may also need to
   link to some Fortran runtime libraries such as ``libfifcore-mt.lib``.
   The easiest way to do this is to source the ifort compiler using e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat``.

Compiling using CMake
---------------------

A CMakeLists.txt file is supplied in the examples folder of your installation. You will need to set ``AOCL_ROOT`` to point to your AOCL installation.
On Windows you may also need to source the ifort compiler using e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat``.
To configure cmake and compile, you can then use commands similar to:

.. code-block::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl ..
    cmake --build .


Miscellaneous Topics
====================

Data Types in AOCL-DA
---------------------

.. _da_int:

AOCL-DA uses the ``da_int`` integer type throughout the library.
For the 32-bit integer library (``LP64``) this is defined to be a 32-bit signed integer.
For the 64-bit integer library (``ILP64``, compiled with the CMake flag ``-DBUILD_ILP64=On``) this is defined to be a 64-bit signed integer.
When compiling your own code to use the 64-bit integer library, you must ensure that the ``AOCLDA_ILP64`` build variable is set.

.. _da_real_prec:

Algorithmic routines operating on floating-point data are typically available in both
single and double precision.
Routines expecting single precision data have ``_s`` appended onto their names.
Routines expecting double precision data have ``_d`` appended onto their names.
Some routines (such as option setting routines) may expect other data types, and will have ``_int``or ``_string``` appended onto their names accordingly.
In this documentation we frequently use ``_?`` at the end of routine names to indicate a suite of routines that differ only in the expected data type.

Array Storage
-------------

Algorithmic routines in the library expect two-dimensional arrays to be in column major format.

Interpreting Missing Data
-------------------------

When using a :cpp:type:`da_datastore` for data management, the special convention for floating point *not a number* (``NaN``) can be used to denote missing
data. See :ref:`Data Management Functionalities<data-management>` for further details.

In order to provide the best possible performance, the algorithmic functions will not check for
``NaN`` data. If a ``NaN`` is passed into an algorithmic function, its behaviour is undefined.
It is therefore the user's responsibility to ensure data is sanitized (for example, by using
:cpp:func:`da_data_select_non_missing`) before passing it to one of the algorithms.

Error Handling
--------------

Functions in AOCL-DA return :cpp:type:`da_status`, which provides basic information about whether
the function call was successful.
Further information about errors can be obtained by querying :cpp:type:`da_datastore` and
:cpp:type:`da_handle` types. For further details see the :ref:`error handling<error-handling>` pages.

Version String
--------------

To get the version string of AOCL-DA call the function ``const char* da_get_version()``.


.. _cpp_overloads:

C++ overloads
--------------

To facilitate calling AOCL-DA from C++, a set of overloaded functions has been made available.
These are identical to the C interface, except that none of the functions have data type indicators such as ``_s`` or ``_d`` appended onto their names.
Your C++ compiler will instead call the correct function based on the floating point precision you are using.

For some functions, overloading is not possible (for example, functions such as :cpp:func:`da_handle_init_s` and :cpp:func:`da_handle_init_d` do not use ``double`` or ``float`` arguments).
In these cases, templated functions are available (e.g. ``da_handle_init<T>``, where ``T`` can be ``double`` or ``float``).

The complete list of available C++ functions is found in ``aoclda_cpp_overloads.hpp`` in the include folder of your installation (and reproduced below).
