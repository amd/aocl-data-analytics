.. list-table::
   
   * - 0
     - :math:`\sigma = 0`, and an unchanged problem is solved
   * - 1
     - a non-linear least-squares problem of size :math:`n+m`
       is solved implicitly.  Can only be used if :math:`p=2`.
   * - 2
     - a non-linear least-squares problem of size :math:`n+1`
       is solved implicitly.  

See :ref:`regularization` for details.
