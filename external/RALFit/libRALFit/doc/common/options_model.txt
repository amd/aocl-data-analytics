    * - 1 
      - Gauss-Newton (no Hessian).
    * - 2
      - (Quasi-)Newton (uses exact Hessian if ``exact_second_derivatives`` is true, otherwise builds an approximation to the Hessian).
    * - 3
      - Hybrid method (mixture of Gauss-Newton/(Quasi-)Newton, as determined by the package).
    * - 4
      - Newton-tensor method.

See :ref:`models` for details.
